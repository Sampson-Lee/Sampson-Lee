- 👋 Hi, I’m Xinpeng (Sampson) Li.
- 👀 I’m interested in facial expression-related tasks that includ detection, recognition, comparison, and synthesis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer vision and graphics, english writing, and optimization.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a Ph.D. position and a girl friend.
- 📫 If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at (+86) 188 2607 4990 or li.xin.peng@outlook.com.
